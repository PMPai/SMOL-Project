1. "index.html": This is the main HTML file that will contain the structure of the website. It will include references to the other CSS files ("styles.css" and "tailwind.css"). It will contain DOM elements with unique id names that can be used for styling and scripting purposes.

2. "styles.css": This is the main CSS file that will contain custom styles for the website. It will use class and id selectors that match those in the "index.html" file.

3. "tailwind.css": This is the CSS file for Tailwind, a utility-first CSS framework. It will be linked in the "index.html" file and will provide base styles, components, and utilities that can be used throughout the website.

Shared Dependencies:

1. DOM Element IDs: These are unique identifiers for elements in the "index.html" file. They are used in the "styles.css" and "tailwind.css" files to apply specific styles to these elements.

2. CSS Class Names: These are identifiers that can be used on multiple elements in the "index.html" file. They are defined in the "styles.css" and "tailwind.css" files and apply specific styles to elements with these class names.

3. CSS Selectors: These are used in the "styles.css" and "tailwind.css" files to select and style elements in the "index.html" file. They can be element, class, or id selectors.

4. HTML Element Tags: These are used in the "index.html" file to create elements. They can be styled in the "styles.css" and "tailwind.css" files using element selectors.

5. Link to CSS Files: The "index.html" file will have links to the "styles.css" and "tailwind.css" files, allowing it to use the styles defined in these files.
